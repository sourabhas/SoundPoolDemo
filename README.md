* How to use Soundpool for audio effects
* The SoundPool class manages and plays audio resources for applications.
example: sound effects for games, short audios in background,etc
A SoundPool is a collection of samples that can be loaded into memory from a resource inside the APK or from a file in the file system. 
The SoundPool library uses the MediaPlayer service to decode the audio into a raw 16-bit PCM mono or stereo stream. 
This allows applications to ship with compressed streams without having to suffer the CPU load and latency of decompressing during playback.
